Added more functionality into process_client to make sure it can send and recieve data from demo-server. Created a write_to_server function that will write to the server that the client is connected to. Also written a read_server() for a thread to read from before the server and then printing the correct message to standard out.

Added a new reader struct that holds the an int variable which is a fd and another one to determine if the reader is still reading. This struct pointer is passed into void thread function. If eof is found on the socket, the reader variable will be set to 0 (false). Added a new function connection_terminated() that handles when communication has been disconnected. This function was called in write_to_server() function if connection between socket has been terminated.
